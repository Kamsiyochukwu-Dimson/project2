                <h1>About Kamsi Dimson</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is kamsi Dimson. I am an incoming frontend engineer. I love being creative
                    and coding helps me stay creative. <br> I am an Anambra girl from Aguata LGA. 
                    I'm from a family of eight. My hobbies are singing, dancing and being creative. I am a 300Lvevl student of the University of
                    Nigeria, Nsukka. My discipline is Library and Information Science. 
                </p>

                <h2>My Aspirations And Objectives Regarding Upskill</h2>
                <p>
                    My main purpose of joining upskill is to gather a basic knowledge of html, css and java script. I want to use this program to also
                    test my abilities and to become more creative. I am aspiring to be part of the best graduating student after the end of this program.
                    I see Upskill as a stepping stone to my career path as a full stack developer. 
                </p>
